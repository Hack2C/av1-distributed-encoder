# Project Status - AV1 Distributed Transcoding System

## Current State

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025  
**Git Commit:** 5f4132f

## What's Included

### Core Components
- ✅ Standalone transcoding server (`transcode.py`)
- ✅ Master coordination server (`master_server.py`)
- ✅ Worker client (`worker_client.py`)
- ✅ Modern web interface (default)
- ✅ Legacy web interface (accessible at `/old`)

### Configuration
- ✅ Quality lookup tables (video CRF, audio bitrate)
- ✅ Config directory management with persistence
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Docker Compose for all deployment scenarios

### Deployment Options
- **docker-compose.yml** - Full stack (master + worker on same machine)
- **docker-compose.master.yml** - Master server only
- **docker-compose.worker.yml** - Worker node (with SMB/shared storage)
- **docker-compose.filedist-test.yml** - Testing with file distribution mode

### Features Implemented
- [x] Distributed master/worker architecture
- [x] Modern web UI with real-time updates
- [x] Detailed file tracking (resolution, codec, bitrate)
- [x] Job controls (cancel, retry, skip, delete)
- [x] Worker health monitoring with heartbeats
- [x] Time estimates (per-file and overall ETA)
- [x] Processing speed tracking (FPS)
- [x] Worker CPU/memory monitoring
- [x] File distribution mode (HTTP-based, no shared storage)
- [x] Shared storage mode (SMB/NFS)
- [x] Process priority (nice/ionice)
- [x] HDR detection and preservation
- [x] Multi-track audio and subtitles
- [x] Atomic file operations with backups
- [x] Testing mode for safe verification

## Documentation

### Main README
The `README.md` contains comprehensive documentation including:
- Quick start guide
- Installation instructions (Docker and Native)
- Architecture overview
- Configuration reference
- Web interface guide
- Performance metrics
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations
- Project structure
- Development guide

### Removed Documentation
The following files have been consolidated into README.md:
- ~~FILE_DISTRIBUTION_MODE.md~~ → Merged into Architecture section
- ~~IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md~~ → Merged into Features section
- Old scattered notes → Consolidated

## Clean Repository

### What's Tracked
```
Code:
- Python source files (*.py)
- Library modules (lib/)
- Web interface (web/)
- Configuration examples (*.json)
- Docker files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.*.yml)
- Shell scripts (start_*.sh, docker-entrypoint.sh)

Documentation:
- README.md (comprehensive guide)
- requirements.txt
```

### What's Ignored
```
Runtime Data:
- master-data/, worker-data/ (persistent volumes)
- master-temp/, worker-temp/ (temporary files)
- *.db (SQLite databases)
- *.log (log files)

Media:
- Movies/, TV/, TestLib/ (actual media files)

Development:
- __pycache__/ (Python bytecode)
- .env (local environment variables)
- IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
```

## Testing

### Current Test Setup
Running with `docker-compose.filedist-test.yml`:
- 1 Master server (port 8090)
- 2 Workers (file distribution mode)
- Workers have NO direct media access
- Files transferred via HTTP
- SVT-AV1 preset 8 (fast for testing)

### Access
- Web UI: http://localhost:8090
- Legacy UI: http://localhost:8090/old
- API: http://localhost:8090/api/status

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Potential Future Features
- [ ] Pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Priority queue ordering
- [ ] Multi-server master (HA)
- [ ] GPU acceleration support (if hardware available)
- [ ] Email/webhook notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering in UI
- [ ] Export statistics to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Docker image on registry (Docker Hub)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] Grafana dashboard templates
